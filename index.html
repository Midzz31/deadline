            <p>Hello, my name is Mohammed Midhulaj, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Web Development and Cyber Security at the University of Northampton. My passion for computers and technology stems from a young age, where I was captivated by the endless possibilities that technology offers. This fascination quickly grew into a drive to understand and learn about it in greater depth. My journey into the world of technology began during my primary school years, where I was introduced to basic Information and Communication Technology (ICT). <br> <br>These early experiences sparked my interest and laid the foundation for what would later become a lifelong passion. As I progressed to secondary school, I chose IT as a core subject for my GCSEs, allowing me to deepen my understanding of technology and its applications. Following my secondary education, I embarked on a three-year college journey to further expand my knowledge and skills in computing. This experience was instrumental in providing me with a strong academic and practical grounding in the field.
