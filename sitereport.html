            <p1>
                Learning web development has been an exhilarating journey, filled with growth, challenges, and accomplishments. At first, the idea of designing and coding a fully functional website was overwhelming. Terms like "HTML elements" and "CSS properties" felt foreign, and I feared I wouldn’t be able to grasp the concepts. However, as I began learning step by step, I realized how intuitive and rewarding the process could be. Writing my first piece of code, styling a basic layout, and seeing the results in real time was incredibly satisfying.

                Creating layouts and experimenting with design choices became one of the most enjoyable parts of this experience. I gained a deeper understanding of how structure, colors, and fonts come together to form a cohesive and user-friendly interface. Choosing clean, professional fonts like “Montserrat” and “Roboto” added a modern touch to my site, while soft blue tones provided a calm and welcoming feel. I found inspiration from platforms like Google Fonts and Coolors, which helped guide my decisions.

                Debugging was undoubtedly the toughest challenge. Even minor errors, such as forgetting a closing tag or misplacing a semicolon, could cause unexpected results. While initially frustrating, debugging taught me to think methodically and pay close attention to detail. It was in these moments of problem-solving that I grew the most, both technically and mentally.

                Looking back, this journey has been immensely rewarding. It not only helped me build technical skills but also ignited a passion for web development. Now, I feel excited to explore even more complex projects and continue growing in a field that merges creativity and technology seamlessly.
